A kernel module that models social interactions between processes using custom system calls and a modified scheduler.

## Features

- Each process maintains a profile with social links using `task_struct`
- Scheduler prioritizes processes based on number of received invitations
- Kernel-level implementation using syscall table and in-kernel linked lists

## Technologies
- C
- Linux Kernel 2.4
- Kernel structs and memory
- System call table editing
- Custom scheduling policy
